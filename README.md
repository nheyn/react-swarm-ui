# React SwarmUI
*A javascript/react wrapper that will connect with SwarmUI over WebSockets*

__IN PROGRESS: Only contains connections to ZooidManagerV2, no React yet__

### Install
First download the SwarmUI repo, it will contain the ZooidManagerV2 software in the /Software/Applications/ folder.

To install this code, first clone the repo and then run:
```
npm install
```

### Build
When first installed (and when the code is updated), the build must be run using:
```
npm run build
```

### Test App
Currently this only has a basic program that allows the user to move the Zooids (by default they go back to their own position). To start this program, open ZooidManagerV2 and run:
```
npm run start
```
